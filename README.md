# generalized-anxiety-disorder
I created this website in an effort to spread awareness about Generalized Anxiety Disorder, one of the most common mental health disorder in the United States. I also wanted to raise awareness to the UC Berkeley campus community about various mental health resources that are available on campus that many are not aware of. 

In designing and developing this website, I focused on using warm colors (unlike dark colors that are typically used in association with mental health). Further, I aimed to make the content approachable and friendly to the average college student. I was determined to make the website as interactive as possible in order to keep the user engaged with the content.
